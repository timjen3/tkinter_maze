# tkinter_maze

Generates each floor the first time it is reached using a dumb procedural method.

When revisiting a floor, it is loaded from memory.

Keyboard commands are arrow keys and Esc to save and quit.

Save and quit will save the floorplan to a local file. If that file is found on progam loading it will be used.
